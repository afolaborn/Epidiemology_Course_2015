# Epidiemology_Course_2015

This is a repository for lecture materials (stata) for a  course that I taught in 2015 tagged: "understanding Health and Demographic Surveillance Data Agincourt Case Study". This is part of a degree programme in the School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa titled: "Master of Science in Epidemiology in the field of Population-Based Field Epidemiology".

The stata do files do the following:
1. Imports data from an MS Accesss file using ODBC;
2. Converts data from wide to short format;
3. Renames and recodes the variables where necessary;
4. Checks the data for inconsitency;
5. Create an event matrix;
6. Performs date conversion;
7. Performs event history analysis or time to event analysis;
